# opensdk-spec
OpenSDK for creating shared documentation and naming conventions across enginneering teams

# Reason

this spec wasccreated because I saw a gap in how teans building native SDKs communicated. Over time, each native implementation diveerged into different patterns for naming functions and variables that there was no
consistency. This spec and the accompanying generator repos ( docs and code ) represent a toolbox that teams can rely on to provide governance and up-to-date documentation.
